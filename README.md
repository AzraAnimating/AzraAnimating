### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:

I'm a German High School (Gymnasium) Student & Freelance Developer and I'm currently building a Company ([Zyonic Software](https://github.com/zyonic-software/)) with a couple of friends.

If you are wondering why my Personal Account here is so empty, I mostly work on Projects that are Privated or ones that are Zyonic Projects. I only post the accasional "fun" thing over here, or some Librarys I designed.

I'm currently working on a few Discord-Bots like Herukan (which is based on my [Maddox](https://github.com/zyonic-software/maddox-v2/) framework) and some Minecraft stuff.

### ðŸ‘¯ Working with me

If you need assistance in any Project involving Minecraft, Elite:Dangerous Data Collection or Discord, feel free to contact me, and I'll help you if I like your Project, providing I have time of course.

### ðŸ“« Contacting

If you want to get in touch with me (for whatever reason) contact me on Discord (AzraAnimating#3851).
