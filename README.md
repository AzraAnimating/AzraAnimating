### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:

I'm a German Student & Freelance Developer and I'm currently building a Company ([Zyonic Software](https://gitlab.zyonicsoftware.com/)) with a couple of friends.
Currently I'm studying Applied Computer Science at the Ruhr UniversitÃ¤t Bochum in Germany.

If you are wondering why my Personal Account here is so empty, I mostly work on Projects that are Privated or ones that are Zyonic Projects. I only post the accasional "fun" thing over here, or some Librarys I designed.

I'm currently working on many Projects. Many of those are sadly Closed-Source, but I like to share whatever I can over here.
If you want to check out some of my personal Work you can look at my [Uni's Gitlab](https://gitlab.rub.de/tobi) or [Zyonic's Gitlab](https://gitlab.zyonicsoftware.com/azraanimating)

### ðŸ‘¯ Working with me

If you need assistance in any Project involving Minecraft, Elite:Dangerous Data Collection or Discord, feel free to contact me, and I'll help you if I like your Project, providing I have time of course.

### ðŸ“« Contacting

If you want to get in touch with me (for whatever reason) contact me on Discord (AzraAnimating#3851).
